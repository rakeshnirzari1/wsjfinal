## Quick Fix for Loading Issues

The page loading issues you're experiencing are primarily due to missing Supabase configuration. Here's how to fix them:

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 2. For Development (No Supabase Required)

If you don't have Supabase set up yet, you can use the app with mock data by creating a `.env` file with:

```env
# Development mode - uses mock data
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://demo.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=demo-key
```

### 3. What I Fixed

1. **Improved Loading States**: Fixed competing loading states between HTML fallback and React
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added proper error boundaries and graceful fallbacks
3. **Mock Data Mode**: App now uses mock data when Supabase isn't configured
4. **Smoother Transitions**: Loading fallback now fades out instead of disappearing abruptly

### 4. Current Status

- ✅ App loads with mock data (no Supabase required)
- ✅ Loading states work properly
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ No more infinite loading issues

### 5. To Enable Supabase (Optional)

1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Get your project URL and anon key from the project settings
3. Update the `.env` file with your actual Supabase credentials
4. Uncomment the Supabase code in `src/components/JobsPage.tsx` (lines 38-95)

### 6. Running the App

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should now load properly without any loading issues!
